Using the Global Shark Attacks dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks), the live interactive site linked above was created. 

The dataset included over 6,000 worldwide shark attack events. Using MongoDB the data was filtered to only include events from Canada, USA, and Mexico which reduced the dataset to 265 events.
