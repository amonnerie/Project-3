Files to review: logic.js, index.html, style.css. The remaining files are resources used in the code (images, datasets, etc)

The live, interactive site linked above was created using the Global Shark Attacks dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

The dataset included over 6,000 worldwide shark attack events. Using MongoDB, the data was filtered to only include events from Canada, USA, and Mexico which reduced the dataset to 265 events. 

Each visual on the website was created using a different JavaScript library. The map was created with Leaflet, the chart was created with DataTables, and the bar graph was created using Plotly.
